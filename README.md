# Matrix Multiplication Performance Benchmark

This script benchmarks matrix multiplication performance using various libraries on both CPU and GPU. The results are visualized to compare the computational efficiency of each setup.

## Overview

The code tests matrix multiplication performance with:
- **PyTorch** on both CPU and GPU
- **NumPy** on CPU
- **CuPy** on GPU

The script performs repeated matrix multiplications for matrices of increasing sizes, measuring the time taken for each configuration. The results are then plotted for easy comparison.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:
  - numpy.
  - cupy and pytorch for your Nvidia cuda toolkit version.
